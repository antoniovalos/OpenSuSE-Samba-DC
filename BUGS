Uppon done chat & mails with Samba folkes they expect that MIT KRB5 will not been ready for Samba ADS bevor 2016 
as the BUG / featgter List  to get MIT-KRB5 up and running with Samba-ads SERVER are highly LONG. 

MIT-KRB5 works  as ADS  Client( domain jojn OK ) , but not as DAS DC Server currently..



samba NTDB 
-----------

NTDB from GIT  currently (jan2014 )not build as system-build-ntdb the required libntdb_util.so 
Comparing the samba-4.1.3 ´s NTDB(0.9) with the officialy NTDB (~1.0):
ntdb.h and libs found , but linking failed due required libary missed as not build.
Bug report has been send to samba-technical list.


GOSA(v1/v2) / Gosa-NG(v3)
--------

Current Gosa releases are known not able to manage Samba ADS

Gosa-NG maybe will never reach Stable as OpenSource Contrubutiers moved to an Free Opensoure Fork.
